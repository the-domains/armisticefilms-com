  Actor and Activist Ryan Boyko founded Armistice Films in October of 2010. The
  film company began as a direct result of Mr. Boyko’s passion to tell the story
  of Canada’s first national internment operations through the power of cinema.
  It is a story of those lured to Canada by the false promise of a dream - hated
  when they arrived, turned into prisoners and slaves in the prime of their
  lives, in a country that promised them a chance, yet never told the story of
  their affliction. It is a subject struck from Canadian history books in the
  early 1950s.

Actor and Activist Ryan Boyko founded Armistice Films in October of 2010\. The film company began as a direct result of Mr. Boyko's passion to tell the story of Canada's first national internment operations through the power of cinema. It is a story of those lured to Canada by the false promise of a dream - hated when they arrived, turned into prisoners and slaves in the prime of their lives, in a country that promised them a chance, yet never told the story of their affliction. It is a subject struck from Canadian history books in the early 1950s.

The name Armistice represents a cease-fire, the end of war and a coming together with common understanding. It comes from Ryan Boyko's vision and mandate of commemoration. It is important to honour those who have come before and to commemorate their memory in a significant way.

All of the Projects created by Armistice Films and currently under development by Armistice Films share this common theme of peace and understanding through stories that are difficult and often unsettling, yet must be told in an effort to remember, reconcile and heal.

Since its founding, Armistice Films has been commissioned to create several independent film projects for various organizations, including The Ukrainian Canadian Foundation of Taras Shevchenko and 2 projects for the Ukrainian Canadian Civil Liberties Association. Armistice Films recently produced "The Camps", a documentary series which visits all known internment sites across Canada, and will be released every Thursday beginning September 8th 2016 at 1pm EST on the Armistice Films Youtube Channel.

The company is currently in high gear, financing Enemy Aliens. Armistice Films is the first Canadian company to receive funding directly from Ukraine through a contribution of 1.5 million Canadian from the Ukrainian State Film Agency. Armistice Films is working to raise an additional 3.8 Million CAD to begin filming Enemy Aliens this year. The making of this film will honour the trials and sacrifice of thousands of Ukrainians, Poles, Italians, Bulgarians, Croatians, Turks, Serbians, Hungarians, Russians, Jews, Slovaks, Slovenes, Czechs and Romanians whose home country was under the Austro-Hungarian Empire's rule. Their freedom was stripped and they were forced into work camps. Many lost everything between the years 1914 - 1920\.****
