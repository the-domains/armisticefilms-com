32 episode web series on Canada's First National Internment Operations

**Log Line**

Over 8000 people were wrongfully imprisoned in 24 internment camps during World War One. A select group of people fought to ensure these prisoners were remembered.

**Setting**

This is a Nationwide look at Canada's First National Internment Operations; discussions with scholars, Government officials, and leaders in the affected communities. This documentary will feature all 24 Internment Camps, then and now.

**Synopsis**

Following in the footsteps of the Endowment Council of The Canadian First World War Internment Recognition Fund, 'The Camps' sheds light on a dark time in Canadian History. In an effort to explain the xenophobia of the day "The Camps" looks at both sides of the narrative, both for and against internment and highlights some of the actions taken to remember the 8,579 so-called "enemy aliens", including women and children.

Prisoners interned included: Ukrainians, Alevi Kurds, Armenians, Bulgarians, Croatians, Czechs, Germans, Hungarians, Italians, Jews, Ottoman Turks, Polish, Romanians, Russians, Serbians, Slovaks, and Slovenes.

**Background**

Between 1914 and 1920 over 8000 people were wrongfully imprisoned in Internment Camps in Canada. In 1954 this History was removed from Canadian textbooks. All known documents were destroyed. Some survived! In 2008 the Government of Canada gave a ten million dollar endowment, to ensure that Canadians would remember. This is a story of commemoration and memory.
